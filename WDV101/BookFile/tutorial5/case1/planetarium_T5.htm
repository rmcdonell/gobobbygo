<h1>Shore River Planetarium</h1>

<h2>What is a Planetarium?</h2>

<p>A planetarium is a building with a domed ceiling that uses special projection equipment to reproduce images of the night sky. A planetarium offers the visitor a theatre-like experience in that the room itself is dark, and the show is narrated, usually by a famous actor or actress.</p>

<p>Each season, the planetarium offers different shows based upon the night sky of that particular season. Shows run for a period of about three months and are not repeated after that. If you visited the planetarium more than three months ago, there's a new show that you havevn't seen yet waiting for you. Of course, there's no harm in seeing the same show more than once, as many people do. Most shows are about 42 minutes long, which allows time for exit and entry between shows. Shows start on the hour every hour the planetarium is open. The planetarium is not only a place to enjoy a show about the stars, but it's also a place to experience what the stars are about. A visit to the planetarium is interesting, educational, and fun.</p>
