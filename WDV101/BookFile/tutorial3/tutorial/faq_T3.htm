  <h1>FAQ</h1>


  <h2>Do you provide a baby seat?</h2>

  <p>
  Some cars are equipped with baby seats. You can also bring your own and secure it with the taxi’s seat belts. Please let the dispatcher know that you require a baby seat.
  </p>

  <h2>Why did an empty Classic Taxi cab not stop for me?</h2>

  <p>
  It's possible that the driver was dispatched to another call. It is also possible that the driver did not see you. Please extend your arm fully when hailing a cab. If the driver has already been dispatched to another call, he or she will notify the dispatcher and another cab will be sent to your location quickly.
  </p>

  <h2>Do you provide a bike rack?</h2>

  <p>No, at this time we do not provide a bike rack. We are not able to transport bicycles or large items in our classic cabs.</p>
