<h1><em>Hooks, Wheels, and Ladders</em></h1>
<p>Kids Love the Shapes; Grown Ups Love the Taste</p>
<p>Introducing the first snack food that everyone can enjoy: new <em>Hooks, Wheels, and Ladders</em>. Yes, <em>Hooks, Wheels, and Ladders</em> is a snack with everyone's good health in mind. Let's start by leaving out the preservatives. Some snack foods have the shelf life of plutonium &mdash; not so with <em>Hooks, Wheels, and Ladders</em>. All of our varieties of <em>Hooks, Wheels, and Ladders</em> come in snack-sized pouches that are flavored-sealed for freshness and taste. <em>Hooks, Wheels, and Ladders</em> snacks are baked, not fried. There are no saturated fats in our snacks. We also hold the line on salt with low-salt and no-added-salt varieties. We also use sea salt, rather than table salt, which adds both flavor and nutrition.</p>

<p>We don't hold back the flavor, though. We pair up ranch hooks with salsa ladders. We also toss in a variety of hooks, which are either corn, wheat or rice crackers, depending on the flavor you buy. It's fun to play with our snacks, but we think you'll spend most of your time eating the many varieties of <em>Hooks, Wheels, and Ladders</em>. Try our latest taste adventure &mdash; veggie hooks and ladders. We use our homegrown potatoes and other vegetables to come up with a flavor that is as taste tempting as it is unique.</p>

<p>Look for our prize surprise packages. Every box of <em>Hooks, Wheels, and Ladders</em> comes with a secret surprise. You may win a coupon for your next purchase of <em>Hooks, Wheels, and Ladders</em> or you may win an all-expenses-paid trip to go on one of our fabulous European or Caribbean holidays.
