  <h1 id="top">Is There Life On Other Planets?</h1>

  <h2>A Planetary Daily Life</h2>

  <h3 class="clear">Habitat and Characteristics</h3>
  <p>
  	Have you ever wondered if Earth is the only planet that can sustain life?  Of all the vast universe we are the only planet that has life.  It may appear that in our contained solar system we are the one source of living beings.
  </p>
	 <h3>Landscape</h3>

  <p><img src="images/Planet picture2.jpg" alt = "Landscape" class = "right"/></p>
  
  <p>  What would a planet that could sustain life look like?  Could it be full of ice? or really hot?  Would they require water as we do?  Would there be mountains and plants, animals and minerals?  Would those beings have the same appreciation for natural beauty as we do?  Would a more sophisticated life species hold more adaptability to preserve a more natural landscape?  Woud they have crops, gardens and irrigation systems?</p>
  
  <h3>Behaviors</h3>

  <p> What would life on another planet look like?  Would there be intelligent life?  Would they eat, breathe and require sleep?  How woud their society perform?  Would they have a more developed society or would they be considered Primitive?  Would they live in peace or struggle for domination for power?
  </p>

  <p> Would another Species on anotoher planet have mastered science?  What about nature?  Or would they have magic and abilities far beyond those of earthlings?   Could they have tapped into their own body systems to utilize more control</p>
