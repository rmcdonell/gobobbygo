Just swipe your Food Store savings card and you are ready to start saving on everythingthat's on sale in the store.  If you want to really zip in and out of our store, just grab a price scanner on the way in and take a few paper shopping bags as well.  Scan the items before you place it in a bag.  As you travel through the store, the price scanner will alert you on whats on sale in that aisle.  You'll get <strong>discounts on items</strong> you have in your purchase history, and you will get coupons for items that are not on sale.</h4>
